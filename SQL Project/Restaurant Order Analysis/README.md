# Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing eCommerce data using SQL to uncover key business insights. The dataset consists of five dimension tables—customer, item, store, time, and transactions—alongside a fact table that consolidates sales metrics. By leveraging SQL queries, this analysis explores patterns in customer behavior, product performance, store efficiency, and sales trends over time. The goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights that support strategic decision-making in an eCommerce environment.
